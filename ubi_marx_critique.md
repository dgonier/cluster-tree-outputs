**Abstract**

In this paper, we delve into the intriguing and potential revolutionary implications of implementing a Universal Basic Income (UBI) from a Marxist perspective. We explore how UBI, an economic model that guarantees a basic income to all members of society regardless of their work status, could impact the societal and class dynamics ingrained in capitalist societies. While UBI promises to alleviate financial stress and alter employment relationships for the better, we argue that its effect, if implemented within the current capitalist structures, may have potential conciliatory consequences. By adopting a Marxist lens, we tease apart both sides of this economic concept, exploring the potential for UBI to both challenge and reaffirm the existing status quo, possibly pacifying the working-class struggle instead of catalyzing revolutionary change. 

**Introduction**

The increasing gap in wealth and income inequality has intensified the debate around potential remedies and reforms, with the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI) emerging as a particularly compelling proposal. UBI, characterised by its universality, unconditionality, and potential to cover basic needs, promises to reshape the social fabric, providing a buffer against poverty and giving individuals freedom from financial fear. However, within the capitalist structure - a system that thrives on the exploitation of the working class for capital accumulation - the infusion of UBI becomes a topic of profound implications. Through a Marxist lens, that recognizes class struggle as the central dynamism underlying social changes, the introduction of UBI carries potential both emancipative and pacifying implications. 

While UBI presents a utopian image of financial security and autonomy, its impact on societal norms, class struggle, and the established capitalist system is significantly more complex. This paper critically explores the theories and arguments put forth by thinkers like Corbyn, Standing, Marx, and others to understand these complexities. It evaluates UBI's potential to assuage immediate financial hardship, redistribute power within employment relations, and challenge the dominant capitalist economics. Conversely, this essay also teases out arguments around UBI's potential conformation to capitalist models and its consequence in potentially assuaging the revolutionary momentum of the proletariat class.### From a Marxist perspective, the introduction of Universal Basic Income (UBI) potentially neutralizes the revolutionary potential of the proletariat

Karl Marx, a seminal figure in the development of socialist theory, provided a critique of capitalism that revolved around the exploitation of the proletariat or the working class by the bourgeoisie, the capitalist class that owns the means of production. As per Marx's analysis, capitalism thrives on the exploitation of the working class who sell their labor power against wages, thus producing surplus value for the capitalists \([Labour power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_power)\). In that sense, Marx believed in the revolutionary potential of the proletariat to overthrow the capitalist system.

While Universal Basic Income (UBI) has been proposed as a solution to income inequality and economic insecurity in capitalist societies, it can be seen as potentially neutralizing this revolutionary potential from a Marxist perspective. Past social theories have demonstrated how seemingly beneficial social reforms can sometimes serve the interests of the ruling capitalist class \([Dialectical and Historical Materialism](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1938/09.htm)\). It could be argued that providing UBI might create an illusion of financial autonomy and freedom among the working class. However, this does not necessarily result in a fundamental shift in the capitalist mode of production. On the contrary, it might further entrench the exploitation structures in capitalist societies by maintaining the proletariat's dependence on money distributed by the state or capitalists and thus, keeping them in the cycle of exploitation.

UBI could potentially pacify the working class and might create a semblance of an equal society, while still preserving the basic structure of capitalism. In the words of Marx, "The capitalist may safely leave its fulfilment to the labourer's instincts of self-preservation and of propagation. All the capitalist cares for, is to reduce the labourer's individual consumption as far as possible to what is strictly necessary" \([Labour power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_power)\). Hence, despite the provision of a universal basic income, the basic contradiction of capitalism as identified by Marx, exploitation of labor, remains unresolved.

Moreover, UBI does not change the power dynamics between the working class and the bourgeoisie. The proletariat remains alienated from the means of production and the bourgeoisie continue to possess the power over resources and wealth. This situation aligns with the premises of the Labour process theory (LPT) which is a Marxist theory that explains antagonistic relationships between employers and employees in capitalist economies \([Labor process theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_process_theory)\). In promoting UBI without restructuring the capitalist system, the exploitation of the working class may be veiled but not eliminated.

From a class-consciousness perspective, this could lead to the working class deviating from the path of revolutionary consciousness. As pointed out by Marx, "socialist views of class-consciousness often refer to a process of more or less spontaneous political maturing through a series of  economic struggles which take on greater and greater magnitude, finally posing  demands which the system cannot meet"  \([Marxism & the Class Struggle](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/slaughte.htm)\). UBI, however, might lower the intensity of these economic struggles without resolving their root cause: the unequal relations of production within capitalist societies.

In conclusion, while UBI could serve as a temporary reprieve in the face of economic insecurity and inequality, it does not inherently challenge the exploitative capitalist mode of production. A Marxist analysis would suggest that UBI could rather potentially pacify the working class and neutralize its revolutionary potential, unless accompanied by significant changes in the structures of capitalist societies.1. Critiques of UBI often focus on potential inflationary effects. But these concerns, though valid, can be mitigated by careful policy implementation, including the adoption of measures like rent controls.
2. Despite these criticisms, UBI holds potential for empowering the working class. By providing a guaranteed income, UBI can function as a safety net that allows individuals to turn down exploitative labor conditions.
3. UBI may enable a radical shift in the power dynamics between workers and employers, potentially generating a new space for collective mobilization and action.
4. Although some critics suggest UBI could discourage revolutionary impulses by fostering complacency, others argue that economic security could provide a platform from which to challenge existing systems and structures.
5. Many debates around UBI reflect deeper tensions and contradictions within capitalist societies and the search for equitable solutions. Marxist analysis, with its focus on class struggle and the dialectic between subject and object, can provide valuable insights into these debates.

Criticisms of universal basic income (UBI) often concentrate on its potential to ignite inflationary tendencies, particularly in labor and housing markets ([Universal basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income)). Yet these critiques, while relevant, can be counterbalanced by thoughtful policy implementation. For instance, the introduction of rent controls could play a substantial part in containing inflationary potentials tied to UBI implementation. 

Moreover, UBI could arguably empower the proletariat class by acting as a social safety net. By assuring a guaranteed income, UBI could provide individuals with the freedom to reject working conditions that exploit them. This shift could potentially create an upheaval in the existing power dynamics between workers and employers, birthing an unprecedented space for collective mobilization and action.

The critiques suggesting that providing economic security through UBI could dull revolutionary impulses and spur societal complacency might not capture the whole picture. Conversely, the economic security that a UBI can provide has the potential to serve as a launching pad for challenging and dismantling existing systems and structures. Far from encouraging stagnation, UBI could actually provide the proletarian class with the tools and the autonomy needed to sow the seeds of revolution.

In essence, the disk of debate surrounding UBI mirrors the deeper contradictions and tensions inherent within capitalist societies. The struggle to find more equitable and sustainable models of social welfare is a reflection of the class struggle— the heart of Marxist theory. Indeed, the Marxist lens, with its focus on the underlying power dynamics of class relations and the dialectic nature of societal change, offers a highly valuable perspective for examining the potentials and pitfalls associated with UBI ([Dialectical and Historical Materialism](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1938/09.htm); [Freedom and Fetishism](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/berman1.htm)).### Finally, it is crucial to consider how these competing perspectives can be reconciled.

Universal Basic Income (UBI) has received increasing attention as a potential solution to socioeconomic inequality within capitalist societies. However, its implementation and implications are not straightforward, particularly from a Marxist standpoint. It is therefore essential to consider how these different perspectives might be reconciled. From a dialectical perspective, which is central to Marxist theory, the introduction of UBI into a capitalist society would likely generate a complex interaction of effects and responses.

UBI's potential to either pacify or catalyze the working class hinges on how it is enacted, and more critically, how it is framed within broader societal and economic structures. For instance, if UBI is implemented as an isolated policy tool without any other changes to the existing system, it could simply serve to uphold the status quo, reducing class struggle by providing a safety net without challenging the exploitative structures of capitalism. In this scenario, UBI risks becoming a tool that maintains the existing power dynamics rather than disrupting them, potentially muting the revolutionary potential of the proletariat \([Marxism & the Class Struggle](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/slaughte.htm)\).

However, if UBI is enacted as part of broader socioeconomic reforms aimed at rectifying the inherent inequalities and exploitations of the capitalist system, then it can potentially play a transformative role. In this scenario, instead of merely providing subsistence, UBI could help to empower the working class, enabling people to pursue education, develop individual and collective capacities, and challenge the existing capitalist structures. Drawing from the Marxist perspective, UBI could potentially provide a platform for a shift in power dynamics, creating a more equitable balance between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie \([Marxism & the Class Struggle](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/slaughte.htm)\). 

This transformative potential is underscored when taking a dialectical view of society – a critical component of Marxist theory. The dialectical approach recognizes that social change comes from the tension between opposing forces, the thesis and the antithesis resulting in a synthesis. Thus, the introduction of UBI, as a new element within the capitalist structure, could stir up these tensions and instigate societal restructuring \([Marx’s Dialectic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/#EinD)|)\).

Therefore, the reconciliation of these varying perspectives on UBI in a capitalist society entails acknowledging its dual potentials: as a tool that either upholds or challenges the status quo. Its actual impact will greatly depend on its implementation and contextualization within broader societal and economic structures. Considering this, it becomes pertinent to ensure that UBI, if implemented, is accompanied by a comprehensive restructuring of these structures towards creating a more equitable society. This aligns well with Marx's vision of a society where the means of production are democratically controlled, effectively eradicating the root cause of workers' exploitation). Only then can UBI emerge as an instrument that fundamentally supports the actualization of Marx’s vision of an equitable society rather than merely pacifying the proletariat class.1. **UBI, Inequality, and Exploitation in the Capitalist System:** From a Marxist perspective, capitalism in its very nature is inextricably intertwined with inequality and exploitation. Rooted deeply in the Marxist critique of capitalism is the "surplus value theory," which suggests that the workers are exploited as they are paid less than the value they produce, with the surplus value appropriated by the capitalists or the bourgeoisie. As described in Marx's work, "Exploited labor would be the driving force behind a revolution" ([Perspectives on capitalism by school of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspectives_on_capitalism_by_school_of_thought)). A UBI, albeit offering a basal economic security for the working class, does not address this structural exploitation and might even act as a buffer that prevents revolutionary challenges against the status quo.

2. **UBI as a Palliative Measure:** In the capitalist framework, exploitation is not an anomaly but an inherent, systemic attribute. Implementing UBI could indeed relieve the immediate suffering caused by poverty. However, from a Marxist standpoint, it could potentially soothe the quest for a more deep-rooted socio-economic transformation. UBI might be viewed as a palliative measure, alleviating the symptoms of poverty but not challenging the "contradictory totality of social economic relations" that fuel poverty and inequality ([Marxism & the Class Struggle](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/slaughte.htm)).

3. **Preserving the Capitalist Status Quo:** Providing a UBI could inadvertently serve to uphold the capitalist status quo. By tackling the manifestations of wealth disparity—such as poverty and income insecurity—without directly confronting the systemic factors that generate these issues, UBI could potentially even strengthen the capitalist system by promoting social stability and reducing discontentment within the exploited classes. From the Marxist perspective, this could be seen as a strategy by the dominant class to mitigate class conflict and avoid the overhaul of the capitalist mode of production. As Marxists argue, only "a revolutionary solution" that addresses the systemic root causes of inequality could bring an end to class antagonism and pave the way to a truly egalitarian society ([Marxism & the Class Struggle](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/slaughte.htm)).

4. **The Need for Structural Transformation:** Ultimately, a Marxist critique of UBI reinforces the need for a radical, structural transformation of capitalism. A UBI does not challenge systemic inequality by redistributing wealth or giving workers control over the means of production. It does not transform property relations or alleviate the alienation of labor. As Marx envisaged, "The free development of each will be the condition for the free development of all". This requires a transcendence of the capitalist paradigm, a transition to a socialist society where labor is not exploited, and wealth is not concentrated in the hands of a minority ([Dialectical and Historical Materialism](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1938/09.htm)).

In summarizing, while UBI could improve the conditions of many under the capitalist system, it does not strive for the more profound changes encouraged by Marxist theory. Only by addressing the root causes of inequality and exploitation can we hope to free society from these systemic injustices."Nevertheless, UBI could also have potentially positive societal impacts, particularly in terms of alleviating poverty and fostering economic security. Moreover, it might allow people to better participate in society, engage in creative or voluntary work, or seek education and training opportunities, which is not necessarily in conflict with Marxist principles.

First, let's consider the potential to alleviate poverty and bolster economic security. According to a [TED Talk by Rutger Bregman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income), UBI is seen as a potential way to reduce poverty and foster economic security, two significant social issues that reflect the flaws of capitalism. UBI, if implemented as proposed, could theoretically elevate everyone above the poverty line, ensuring at least a minimum level of financial stability for all.

Furthermore, in the book [Basic Income:  A Radical Proposal for a Free Society and a Sane Economy by Philippe Van Parijs and Yannick Vanderborght](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income), in their review by Friedman, they argue that UBI could help foster economic security by providing a steady stream of income that individuals could depend on, regardless of their employment status. This could potentially enable people to weather economic downturns or personal crises more effectively.

Moreover, this economic security could facilitate greater participation in society and free individuals to pursue education, training, creative work, and voluntary activities. According to the proponent's view on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income), basic income could increase economic growth because it would sustain people while they invest in education to get higher-skilled and well-paid jobs. Indeed, as seen in [Marx's philosophy](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/slaughte.htm), he notes the importance of labor in its various forms, thereby supporting the notion that all forms of work are vital and should be recognized and compensated, whether it be learning, creating, or helping others.

Furthermore, in [Marx's 'Critique of the Gotha Programme'](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/slaughte.htm), he argues that the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all, implying that by helping individuals achieve financial freedom, we also enable society as a whole to develop and flourish. From this perspective, UBI is not necessarily in direct conflict with Marxist principles; rather, it could be seen as a way to work towards a society where everyone has the means to develop and contribute meaningfully.

In conclusion, UBI, while contested, has the potential to hold considerable positive societal impacts. While the debate will undoubtedly continue, contemplating its implications against the background of different ideological standpoints can certainly provide a more nuanced understanding of this concept and its potential implications in the societal realm."**The Potential of UBI to Either Perpetuate or Mitigate Societal Suffering likely Hinges on How the Policy is Framed, Implemented, and Funded**

Correctly framed and implemented, UBI has the potential to significantly reduce suffering and enhance societal wellbeing, aligning with many of Marx's critical values. Nonetheless, the way UBI is handled and funded will likely significantly impact its effectiveness and its ability to mitigate or merely perpetuate the societal suffering resulting from capitalist exploitation.

**Robust Framing and Implementation Strategies:** For UBI to be an effective tool in alleviating societal suffering, proper framing and robust implementation strategies are vital. By ensuring that UBI is seen as a right for all citizens rather than a form of welfare, the stigma associated with receiving assistance can be minimized ([The Case for Universal Basic Income by Annie Lowrey](https://www.amazon.com/Give-People-Money-Universal-Wealth/dp/1524763245)). Moreover, a successful implementation strategy would necessitate massive systemic changes including a fair and sustainable way to fund the policy and adjusted wages that reflect the existence of a basic income. 

**Impacts of Funding Approach:** The approach to funding UBI is a significant factor that will impact its ability to either lessen or deepen societal suffering. For example, if UBI is funded through increased taxes on the wealthy, it could serve as a mechanism for wealth redistribution, thereby aligning with Marx’s principles of a fair and just society. However, if it is funded by cuts to other social programs, UBI could potentially reproduce societal suffering by failing to address other systemic issues such as access to healthcare or quality education ([The Future We Choose: Surviving the Climate Crisis](https://www.amazon.com/Future-We-Choose-Surviving-Climate/dp/0525658351)).

**Structural Transformation versus Symptom Alleviation:** Crucially, UBI should be viewed as a part of broader systemic change rather than as a standalone solution to capitalist exploitation. A Marxist perspective emphasizes the need for significant socio-economic transformation, a change that addresses the root causes of societal suffering rather than merely treating its symptoms. Thus, UBI should additionally be supported by measures aimed at reducing wealth and income inequality, promoting workers’ rights, and providing equal opportunities for all ([The Marx-Engels Reader](https://www.amazon.com/Marx-Engels-Reader-Second-Karl/dp/039309040X)).

In conclusion, the way UBI is framed, implemented, and funded will substantially impact its potential to either mitigate or perpetuate societal suffering. To truly align it with Marxist values and maximize its benefits, UBI should be viewed and employed as a part of a broader socio-economic transformation rather than merely a patch-up for the flaws of capitalist exploitation.1.

**Introduction of Universal Basic Income: A Marxist Perspective**

With the backdrop of increasing income inequality, the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI) has garnered significant attention among policymakers and scholars. Under a Marxist lens, the introduction of UBI has noteworthy implications for societal impacts and class dynamics. Primarily, it alleviates immediate financial stresses for individuals within the proletariat class but also challenges the prevailing capitalist employment model and alters the fundamental nature of employment relationships.

An initial analysis in Marxist socio-economic terms reveals that the implementation of UBI could potentially alleviate pressing financial burdens for members of the proletariat class. As Marx stresses in "Capital (Marxism)" "[Labour and capital are viewed as historically specific forms of social relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(Marxism))". A guaranteed income provides a safety net, protecting workers from complete financial devastation, thus addressing Marx's concern on the domination of the labourer by the product. Besides addressing basic physiological needs, it also frees individuals to pursue education, creative projects, and other self-improving activities. Marx vis-a-vis in "[Labour power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_power)" argues that "All the capitalist cares for is to reduce the labourer's individual consumption as far as possible to what is strictly necessary". A UBI could therefore counteract this capitalist tendency by ensuring a basic level of consumption for all.

Secondly, the introduction of UBI could modify the inherent nature of employment relationships. Under capitalism, as per Marx's "[Labour process theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_process_theory)", the workplace is characterized by tensions between employer and employee over autonomy, control, and deskilling. With the safety net of a UBI, workers have increased bargaining power and are better positioned to negotiate working conditions, wages, and hours. It decentralizes power from the capitalists and distributes it among the labourers, truly embodying Marx's principle that "Workers of the world unite; you have nothing to lose but your chains!"

Lastly, UBI poses a direct challenge to the prevailing capitalist employment model. The current model largely hinges on workers' dependence on their employers for survival. A UBI would break this dependency, fundamentally altering the relationship between labour and capital. As Marx wrote, "Marxists view capital as a social relation reproduced by the continuous expenditure of wage labour" ([Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism)). By granting all individuals a basic income, we create a societal structure less based on exploitation and more grounded on equal opportunity. This paradigm shift could lead us towards what Marx envisioned as the realm of freedom - 'the free development of each will be the condition of the free development of all'.

In conclusion, the introduction of UBI can have significant societal impacts through a Marxist lens. While it mitigates immediate financial stress for the working class, it also has profound implications on the prevailing capitalist employment model and the core nature of employment relationships. As society moves forward in addressing income inequality and workers' rights, the perspectives and insights from Marxist theory will continue to offer invaluable insights and guidance.Critique from Capitalist Class and Maintenance of Existing Class Structures

The introduction of a universal basic income (UBI) often derives intense criticism from various societal quarters, particularly from the capitalist class, patriarchal men, bureaucrats, and politicians who hold stakes in the current systems (GlobalBasicIncome, 2019). Of specific concern is the potential of UBI, if not implemented carefully, to inadvertently cement existing class structures and power dynamics, rather than dismantling them.

Critics claim that a basic income at an appropriate level for all citizens is not financially feasible (Universalbasicincome, 2019). This argument aligns with the capitalist class's interests, who are poised to face considerable economic losses should UBI be enacted at a level that goes beyond covering basic needs. 

A provision of a UBI that only caters for primary needs could potentially exacerbate income inequalities rather than mitigating them. This stance is rooted in the fear that UBI could indeed be a tool for the capitalist class to solidify their grip on wealth and power (Universalbasicincome, 2019).

Under the capitalist system, the proletariat, as Marx defined it, are those members of society whose only significant economic value is their labor power (Proletariat, 2019). If UBI only affords a basic living, proletariats may still be compelled to sell their labor power to capitalists at meager wages, maintaining their marginalized position within capitalism.

Maintaining the proletariat's marginalization implies propagating the "verifiable class relationships" that Marx stipulated, where society is divided into Rentiers, Capitalists, and Workers (Marxian class theory, 2019). Considering this, UBI might end up reinforcing the very class structures it purports to dismantle.

Moreover, the introduction of UBI could further engender class conflict as hypothesized by Marx (Marxian class theory, 2019). Notions of ‘deserving’ and ‘undeserving’ individuals receiving the same amount despite individual needs may spur class tensions (Universalbasicincome, 2019). These perspectives certainly put into perspective the potential of UBI to inadvertently embellish class structures.

In conclusion, the introduction of a UBI must be a careful and considered process if it aims to disrupt rather than to reinforce the class structures inherent in our current systems. To avoid this, some proponents of UBI have suggested that it should be paired with additional measures, such as rent controls, to lessen inflationary pressure and prevent the exacerbation of income inequality.**Understanding the Potential Societal Impact of Implementing UBI in a Capitalist Society Requires a Nuanced and Dialectical Approach**

The implementation of Universal Basic Income (UBI) in a capitalist society presents an intriguing proposition that embodies significant potential economic and societal implications. From a Marxist standpoint, introducing UBI under capitalism could radically reshape class dynamics and employment relationships. Nonetheless, the true impact of UBI is contingent on a multitude of factors, such as the level at which UBI is set, how it is financed, and whether it is supplemented with other progressive reforms.

Setting the correct level of UBI is a critical factor in its implementation. The rate must be appropriate to allow for basic physiological needs – a prerequisite for Marx's long-envisioned social equality. If incorrectly set, it could exacerbate existing income inequalities instead of attenuating them. In this context, Marx's notion of a 'fair wage' comes to mind, regarded as a wage that reflects the true value of the workers' labour power. A UBI that aims to offer a similar level of financial stability would likely be more effective in reducing wealth disparities and promoting social equality.

The financing method of UBI introduces another layer of complexity. Currently, many capitalists argue against its introduction due to a potential increase in taxes. Marx would likely critique this as capitalists working to secure their profiteering interests at the expense of societal good. An equitable financing model would require contributions from varied income strata equitably, avoiding undue strain on the wealthiest whilst still facilitating wealth redistribution.

The implementation of UBI cannot exist in a vacuum. To realize its full potential and mitigate any adverse consequences, it should ideally be complemented by other progressive reforms. For instance, instituting strict rent controls could prevent landlords from exploiting the situation and inflating rent prices. Similarly, interventions to regulate the prices of essential commodities could prevent inflationary pressures.

In conclusion, understanding the potential societal impact of implementing UBI in a capitalist society requires a nuanced and dialectical approach, bearing in mind the multifaceted intricacies involved. As Marx once argued, the goal should not be the simplistic introduction of UBI but the broader aim of formulating an equitable economic structure that ensures social justice while negating the exploitative tendencies of bourgeoisie capitalism.**Conclusion**

The discussion on Universal Basic Income (UBI) within this paper underlines the multifarious possible implications of its entrenchment within a capitalist structure, particularly from a Marxist viewpoint. Our analysis has painted a complex picture, where the introduction of UBI could either lead to the alleviation of financial stress and establish a fairer power dynamic between workers and employers, or it might inadvertently solidify existing class structures, potentially stymying potential revolutionary change. The nuances inherent to this discourse accentuate Marx's own theoretical framework that understanding and critiquing the prevailing social and economic structures need to be rooted in a careful and dialectical approach.

The effectiveness and impact of intended UBI policies would greatly depend on their specific design and implementation, pointing to the need for additional research on this topic. A primary focus should be directed towards the amount set for UBI, the sources of its financing, and whether it is supplemented with complementary reforms to prevent potential inflationary pressure and exacerbation of income inequality. Only then can UBI emerge as an instrument that serves the proletariat's interests rather than solely pacifying them.

The introduction of UBI into a Marxist discourse encourages us to reflect deeply on our current social structures and the potential for fundamental systemic change. The discourse around UBI is part of a larger conversation about societal values, including concepts of fairness, autonomy, and what constitutes a just society. As societal dynamics and technologies continue to evolve, the conversation around UBI will no doubt continue, neverending in its complexity and abundance in rhetorical questions. This paper underpins how engaging with Marx's theoretical ideas can provide vital insights into the potentials and pitfalls associated with UBI and the pursuit of a more equitable and compassionate society.
